            </div>
            <div class="Bregan">
                <p>I want you to deliver an expos√© to Gaxly Rudderbust, the publisher of a local broadsheet called The Waterdeep Wazoo, without his knowing who wrote it or where it came from. You'll find his office at the corner of Immar Street and Stallion Street, in the North Ward. Leave the story on his desk.</p>

                <p>"We've captured a member of the Xanathar Guild, and I'd like you to guard him for three nights until I or another member of Bregan D'aerthe reclaims him. Contact me through our tree and I will tell you how to find him.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="harpers">
                <p>Uza Solizeph is an old woman who sells books out of a narrow three-story building on Sorn Street in the Trades Ward. She claims to have trapped a monster in her shop and fears for the welfare of her books and her cat. The City Watch isn't likely to lend a hand, given Uza's propensity for tall tales, but the Harpers owe her a favor. You'll find her sobbing at Felzoun's Folly, a tavern on the corner of Sorn Street and Salabar Street. Make haste!</p>

            <div class="harpers">
                <p>One of our members, Mattrim Mereg, has allied himself with a gang of doppelgangers and believes the Harpers should recruit them. We need an unbiased opinion. Track down and speak with each of the doppelgangers, and gauge their trustworthiness</p>

            </div>
            <div class="order">
                <p>A notorious thief called the Black Viper, long thought dead, has apparently returned to Waterdeep. She has already robbed at least a dozen noble estates. No one knows her identity because she wears a mask, but it was reported in The Waterdeep Wazoo that she's a noble. Find out what else the broadsheet's publisher knows about her and report back to me.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="order">
                <p>Guards at the Endshift Tavern, located on Endshift Street in the Field Ward, are being robbed nightly, and the innkeeper says he's seen giant rats prowling around the back alleys. Sounds dull, but it's a plea for help that we can't ignore.</p>

                <p>There's a shop in the Trades Ward called Weirdbottle's Concoctions. The gnome who runs it is a friend of ours named Skeemo. He's made some potions of mind reading for a client. Pick up the potions and deliver them to the God Catcher, one of the enormous statues in the Castle Ward. Give the potions to the lady in the purple cloak, and keep the tip.</p>

            <div class="zhent">
                <p>Waterdeep's richest halfling family, the Snobeedles, is offering 500 gold pieces for information leading to the safe return of a missing family member named Dasher Snobeedle. Those dragons sure would look good in our coffers! Investigate and see what you can learn, but don't get in any trouble. The City Watch already has it out for us.</p>

                <p>Seek out Hlam, a monk who lives in a cave on the side of Mount Waterdeep. Ask him what he's heard about threats to the city, but try not to annoy him or overstay your welcome.</p>

                <p>A young bronze dragon has taken up residence in Deepwater Harbor. It startled a few sailors recently but hasn't hurt anyone. Confront the dragon and learn its intentions.</p>

                <p>A member of Force Grey has been acting strangely of late. His name is Meloon Wardragon, and his happy-go-lucky demeanor has soured. He's been hanging around the Yawning Portal more than usual. Observe him for a tenday, then report back to me.</p>
